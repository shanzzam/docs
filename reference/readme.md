title: Horizon Reference
---
Horizon is the server for the client facing API for the Stellar ecosystem.  It acts as the interface between [stellar-core](https://stellar.org/developers/learn/stellar-core) and applications that want to access the Stellar network. It allows you to submit transactions to the network, check the status of accounts, subscribe to event streams, etc. See [an overview of the Stellar ecosystem](https://stellar.org/developers/learn/) for more details.

You can interact directly with horizon via curl or a web browser but SDF provides a [JavaScript SDK](https://stellar.org/developers/learn/js-stellar) for clients to use to interact with Horizon.

SDF runs a instance of Horizon that is connected to the test net [https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/](https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/).

Community maintained libraries (in various states of completeness) for interacting with Horizon in other languages:<br>
- [Ruby](https://github.com/stellar/ruby-stellar-sdk)
- [Go](https://github.com/stellar/go-stellar-base)
- [Python](https://github.com/StellarCN/py-stellar-base)
- [Java](https://github.com/stellar/java-stellar-base)
